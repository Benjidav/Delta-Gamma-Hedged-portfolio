# Delta-Gamma-Hedged-portfolio

From the data provided (stock history, column B) in the file *Dataset*, we want to create the portfolio history replication of a European call with maturity on **31/12/2018**, strike **K = 6**. To do that, we are going to use a **synthetic replication portfolio formed from a stock, cash and another K6.5 European call option** (to neutralize the effect of gamma on the delta of the option). The details of the project and the results are in the file *Report*
